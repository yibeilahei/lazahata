/*
 * See puff.c for purpose and usage.
 *
 * Vendored from https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/puff
 * for XTCH page decompression (raw DEFLATE, no zlib/gzip wrapper). Chosen over
 * zlib's inflate for its tiny footprint (~4K code, <2K stack, no heap use) since
 * decode speed is not the bottleneck here (e-ink refresh dominates page turns).
 *
 * Altered from upstream: puff_stream() inflates from a refill callback so the
 * compressed page does not have to sit in a single heap allocation.
